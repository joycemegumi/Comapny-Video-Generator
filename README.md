Manual content creation involves extensive time and effort by video editors that need to search for video assets, apply copy, styling etc. This process can be time-consuming and may lead to delays in delivering timely content to customers, potentially missing valuable opportunities.

In this project my team built a company video generator web application based on companies datasets from Kaggle. This cutting-edge platform will allow users to effortlessly generate videos by simply selecting their company name and desired theme by leveraging the integration of the [JSON2Video API](https://json2video.com/) and [Pexel API](https://www.pexels.com/api/).
